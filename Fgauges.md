This term (Trinity '25), I am coorganising a reading group / learning seminar on the topic of _Prismatic F-Gauges_, following Bhatt's notes [here](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/mat549f22/lectures.pdf).

## Details

We will meet at **13:30 in C6 on Thursdays**. 


## Plan 

The plan for future weeks is as follows, simply following the chapters of Bhatt's lecture notes [here](https://www.math.ias.edu/~bhatt/teaching/mat549f22/lectures.pdf)

**Week 1 - Organisational Meeting**

**Week 2 - Introductory talk _(Sam)_**
Background to Bhatt's lecture notes: some remarks on p-adic Hodge theory; the definitions of prisms and relative prismatic cohomology; an introduction to work of Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie on the 'stacky' perspective and absolute prismatic cohomology.

**Week 3 - Algebraic de Rham Cohomology, I _(Ken)_** 
Roughly going over sections 2.1-2.4.

**Week 4 - Algebraic de Rham Cohomology, II** _(Arun)_
Covering the remainder of the chapter.

**Week 5 - Crystalline cohomology, the Nygaard filtration, and Mazur's theorem**

**Week 6 - Syntomic cohomology in characteristic p and duality**

**Week 7 - Filtered prismatization in mixed characteristic**

**Week 8 - Syntomification and duality**
